# **The difference between null and undefined**

First of all, Undefined and Null are both basic data types. Each of these two basic data types has only one value, which is undefined and null.

```javascript
let undefinedVar; // undefined
let nullVar = null; // null
```
Undefined means undefined, while null means empty object. When a general variable is declared but not yet defined, it will return undefined. null is mainly used to assign values to variables that may return objects as initialization.
```javascript
let someVar;
console.log(someVar); // undefined

let obj = null;
console.log(obj); // null
```
Undefined is not a reserved word in JavaScript, which means that it can be used as a variable name, but this approach is very dangerous as it can affect the judgment of the undefined value. We can obtain secure undefined values through some methods, such as `void 0`.
```javascript
var undefined = "dangerous"; // This is a bad practice

let safeUndefined = void 0;
console.log(safeUndefined); // undefined
```
When using `typeof` to judge these two types, Null typing will return "object", which is a historical problem. Returns true when using a double equal sign to compare two types of values, and returns false when using a triple equal sign.
```javascript
console.log(typeof null); // "object"
console.log(typeof undefined); // "undefined"

console.log(null == undefined); // true
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

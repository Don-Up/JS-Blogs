### Understanding the Execution Context

#### 1. Types of Execution Context

1. **Global Execution Context**
   - Anything that is not inside a function is in the global execution context. It first creates a global `window` object and sets the value of `this` to this global object. There is only one global execution context in a program.
   ```javascript
   let a = 'Hello World!';
   console.log(this.a); // Output: 'Hello World!' (in browser)
   ```

2. **Function Execution Context**
   - When a function is called, a new execution context is created for that function. There can be multiple function execution contexts.
   ```javascript
   function greet() {
     console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
   }
   greet(); // Output: Hello, undefined (in strict mode)
   ```

3. **eval Execution Context**
   - Code executed within the `eval` function has its own execution context. However, `eval` is not commonly used and will not be discussed further.

#### 2. Execution Context Stack

- The JavaScript engine uses the execution context stack to manage execution contexts.
- When JavaScript executes code, it first encounters global code, creates a global execution context, and pushes it onto the execution stack. When a function call is encountered, a new execution context is created for that function and pushed onto the top of the stack. The engine executes the function at the top of the stack. After the function finishes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and the engine continues with the next context. Once all code is executed, the global execution context is popped off the stack.

```javascript
let a = 'Hello World!';

function first() {
  console.log('Inside first function');
  second();
  console.log('Again inside first function');
}

function second() {
  console.log('Inside second function');
}

first();
// Output:
// Inside first function
// Inside second function
// Again inside first function
```

#### 3. Creating an Execution Context

There are two phases to create an execution context: the creation phase and the execution phase.

1. **Creation Phase**
   - **`this` Binding**
     - In the global execution context, `this` points to the global object (`window` in browsers).
     - In the function execution context, `this` depends on how the function is called. If called by a reference object, `this` is set to that object; otherwise, it is set to the global object or `undefined` (in strict mode).

   - **Creating Lexical Environment Components**
     - A lexical environment is a data structure that maps identifiers (variable/function names) to variables. 
     - The environment record stores the actual location of variable and function declarations and references to external environments, allowing access to the parent scope.

   - **Creating Variable Environment Components**
     - The variable environment is also a lexical environment. Its environment record holds the bindings created by variable declarations within the execution context.

2. **Execution Phase**
   - At this stage, variables are allocated, and the code is executed.

```javascript
// Global execution context is created
let x = 10;

function foo() {
  // Function execution context for foo is created
  let y = 20;
  console.log(x + y); // Accesses global variable x and local variable y
}

foo(); // Output: 30
```

In summary, the execution context is created before executing JS code. During parsing, a global execution context is created, extracting variables and function declarations. Variables are initially assigned `undefined`, and functions are declared and made available. The program then begins formal execution.

Before a function is executed, a function execution context is created, including `this`, `arguments`, and the function's parameters.

- **Global Context**: Variable definitions, function declarations
- **Function Context**: Variable definitions, function declarations, `this`, `arguments`

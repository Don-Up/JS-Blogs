# Print red, yellow and green

A typical problem to compare several asynchronous programming methods: **red light is on for 3 seconds, green light for 1 second, and yellow light for 2 seconds. How can we make the three lights continuously alternate in a repeating sequence?**

To solve this problem of continuously alternating red, yellow, and green lights with specific time intervals, we can implement the logic using different asynchronous programming methods: callbacks, promises, and `async/await`. I'll walk through each method and explain how they work.

### Lighting Functions

First, letâ€™s define the basic lighting functions for the three lights (`red`, `green`, `yellow`):

```javascript
function red() {
    console.log('Red light');
}

function green() {
    console.log('Green light');
}

function yellow() {
    console.log('Yellow light');
}
```

### 1. Implementing with Callbacks

In this approach, we use callbacks to control the sequential execution of tasks (lighting the lights). After each light finishes its timeout, the next light is triggered by calling the next callback function. To ensure the sequence repeats, we use recursion.

```javascript
function task(timer, light, callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        if (light === 'red') {
            red();
        } else if (light === 'green') {
            green();
        } else if (light === 'yellow') {
            yellow();
        }
        callback();
    }, timer);
}

const step = () => {
    task(3000, 'red', () => {
        task(2000, 'green', () => {
            task(1000, 'yellow', step); // Recursively call step to repeat the sequence
        });
    });
};

step(); // Start the light sequence
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - The `step()` function starts with the red light, then calls the next function for the green light, and finally the yellow light.
  - After the yellow light is displayed, `step()` is called again, creating an infinite loop of alternating lights.

### 2. Implementing with Promises

In the promise-based implementation, each light task is represented as a `Promise`. Once a light completes, the next `Promise` in the chain is resolved, ensuring that the lights are displayed in sequence. Instead of using callbacks, we chain the promises.

```javascript
function task(timer, light) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (light === 'red') {
                red();
            } else if (light === 'green') {
                green();
            } else if (light === 'yellow') {
                yellow();
            }
            resolve(); // Resolve the promise after the light has been displayed
        }, timer);
    });
}

const step = () => {
    task(3000, 'red')
        .then(() => task(2000, 'green'))
        .then(() => task(1000, 'yellow'))
        .then(step); // Recursively call step to repeat the sequence
};

step(); // Start the light sequence
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - Each `task()` returns a `Promise`. After the timeout for each light, the promise resolves, triggering the next light in the sequence.
  - The `step()` function chains the promises and calls itself again after all lights have been shown, creating the infinite loop.

### 3. Implementing with `async/await`

The `async/await` approach simplifies the promise-based implementation by making the code more readable. Here, we use the `await` keyword to wait for each light's promise to resolve before moving to the next light.

```javascript
function task(timer, light) {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            if (light === 'red') {
                red();
            } else if (light === 'green') {
                green();
            } else if (light === 'yellow') {
                yellow();
            }
            resolve(); // Resolve the promise after the light has been displayed
        }, timer);
    });
}

async function taskRunner() {
    await task(3000, 'red');
    await task(2000, 'green');
    await task(1000, 'yellow');
    taskRunner(); // Recursively call taskRunner to repeat the sequence
}

taskRunner(); // Start the light sequence
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - The `taskRunner()` function is defined as `async` so we can use `await` to execute the lighting tasks sequentially.
  - After each light's promise is resolved, the next `await` is executed, and once all lights have completed, `taskRunner()` calls itself again to repeat the sequence.

---

### Summary

- **Callback Version**: Manages the sequence by nesting callbacks and uses recursion to repeat the cycle.
- **Promise Version**: Uses promise chaining to ensure sequential execution and recursion to repeat the cycle.
- **`async/await` Version**: Simplifies promise handling by making the code more synchronous and recursive for repetition.

All three implementations create an infinite loop where the red light is on for 3 seconds, the green light for 2 seconds, and the yellow light for 1 second. Each approach has its own strengths, with `async/await` generally being the most readable and modern solution for handling asynchronous operations sequentially.

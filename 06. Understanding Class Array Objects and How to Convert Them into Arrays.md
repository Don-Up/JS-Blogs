### Understanding Class Array Objects and How to Convert Them into Arrays

An object with a `length` attribute and several index properties can be called a class array object. Class array objects are similar to arrays but cannot call array methods. Common class array objects include `arguments` and the return results of DOM methods. Function parameters can also be considered class array objects because they contain the `length` attribute value, representing the number of parameters that can be received.

There are several common methods to convert class array objects into arrays:

1. **Using `slice` Method:**
   Call the `slice` method of the array to implement the conversion.
   ```javascript
   Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLike);
   ```

2. **Using `splice` Method:**
   Call the `splice` method of the array to implement the conversion.
   ```javascript
   Array.prototype.splice.call(arrayLike, 0);
   ```

3. **Using `concat` Method:**
   Use `apply` to call the `concat` method of the array to implement the conversion.
   ```javascript
   Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arrayLike);
   ```

4. **Using `Array.from` Method:**
   Use the `Array.from` method to implement the conversion.
   ```javascript
   Array.from(arrayLike);
   ```

### Example:
```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
  // 'arguments' is a class array object
  const args = Array.from(arguments);
  console.log(args);
}

exampleFunction(1, 2, 3); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Can the Properties of `const` Objects be Modified?

The `const` keyword guarantees that the reference to the memory address that the variable points to cannot be changed. However, it does not mean that the value stored at that memory address cannot be modified.

For basic data types (numbers, strings, boolean values), their values are stored at the memory address that the variable points to, making them equivalent to constants.

For reference types (mainly objects and arrays), the variable points to the memory address of the data, saving only a pointer. `const` can only guarantee that this pointer is fixed, but it cannot control whether the data structure it points to is mutable.

### Example:
```javascript
const obj = { name: 'Alice' };
obj.name = 'Bob'; // This is allowed
console.log(obj.name); // Output: Bob

const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // This is allowed
console.log(arr); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Reassigning the variable will result in an error
// obj = { name: 'Charlie' }; // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

In summary:
- **Class Array Objects:** Can be converted to arrays using methods like `slice`, `splice`, `concat`, or `Array.from`.
- **`const` Objects:** The properties of `const` objects can be modified, but the reference to the object cannot be reassigned.

# Communication between multiple tabs

To implement communication between multiple tabs in a browser, we can utilize several methods that follow the **Mediator Pattern**. Since browser tabs cannot communicate directly with each other, a mediator is used to facilitate communication. This mediator can forward messages between tabs. Below are several methods to achieve this:

### 1. Using WebSocket

The **WebSocket** protocol allows real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server. The server acts as the mediator, receiving data from one tab and forwarding it to other tabs connected to the same server.

**How it works**:
- Each tab establishes a WebSocket connection to the server.
- When a tab sends a message, the server broadcasts it to all connected tabs.
- Tabs receive the message via the WebSocket event listener.

**Example**:
```javascript
// WebSocket setup in each tab
const socket = new WebSocket('wss://your-server-url');

// Listen for messages from the server
socket.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message from server:', event.data);
};

// Send a message to the server
socket.send('Message from one tab');
```

**Use case**: Real-time applications like chat apps, live collaboration tools, or multiplayer games where immediate communication across tabs is needed.

### 2. Using `SharedWorker`

A **SharedWorker** is a type of Web Worker that can be shared between multiple scripts, even across different tabs. Since all tabs share the same worker thread, it can act as a mediator for communication between tabs.

**How it works**:
- A `SharedWorker` is created once, and all tabs share the same instance.
- Tabs communicate with the worker, which acts as a central hub, forwarding messages between tabs.

**Example**:
**SharedWorker script (shared-worker.js):**
```javascript
// Listen for incoming connections
onconnect = function(e) {
    const port = e.ports[0];

    // Listen for messages from a tab
    port.onmessage = function(event) {
        console.log('Received message from tab:', event.data);

        // Broadcast the message to all connected tabs
        port.postMessage('Broadcast: ' + event.data);
    };
};
```

**In each tab:**
```javascript
// Connect to the shared worker
const worker = new SharedWorker('shared-worker.js');
worker.port.start();

// Listen for messages from the SharedWorker
worker.port.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message from SharedWorker:', event.data);
};

// Send a message to the SharedWorker
worker.port.postMessage('Message from this tab');
```

**Use case**: Applications where multiple tabs need to coordinate or share data, such as collaborative editing tools or background synchronization tasks.

### 3. Using `localStorage`

The **`localStorage`** object can be used to store data that is accessible across all tabs of the same origin. The key feature here is the **`storage` event**, which is triggered in other tabs when one tab modifies the `localStorage`.

**How it works**:
- When a tab modifies `localStorage`, other tabs can detect this change via the `storage` event and retrieve the new data.
- The `localStorage` itself acts as the mediator.

**Example**:
```javascript
// Listen for changes to `localStorage` in other tabs
window.addEventListener('storage', function(event) {
    if (event.key === 'sharedData') {
        console.log('New data from another tab:', event.newValue);
    }
});

// Modify `localStorage` in one tab
localStorage.setItem('sharedData', 'Message from one tab');
```

**Use case**: Simple communication between tabs, such as updating preferences, synchronizing settings, or broadcasting small notifications.

### 4. Using `postMessage`

The **`postMessage`** method allows communication between different windows, including tabs, if you have a reference to the other window. This works well when you can get a reference to the other tab, such as through `window.open()`.

**How it works**:
- If a tab has a reference to another tab (or window), it can send messages directly using `postMessage`.
- The receiving tab listens for the `message` event.

**Example**:
**In the parent tab (opening a new tab):**
```javascript
// Open a new tab
const newTab = window.open('https://example.com');

// Send a message to the new tab
newTab.postMessage('Hello from parent tab', '*');
```

**In the new tab (receiving the message):**
```javascript
// Listen for messages from other tabs or windows
window.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
    console.log('Message from another tab:', event.data);
});
```

**Use case**: Tab-to-tab communication when one tab has control over the other (e.g., parent-child window relationships).

### Summary of Methods

| Method             | Mediator             | Use Case                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **WebSocket**      | Server               | Real-time apps where instant messaging across tabs or devices is required (e.g., chat, live data). |
| **SharedWorker**   | Shared thread        | Apps needing coordination between tabs (e.g., collaborative editing, shared states). |
| **`localStorage`** | Browser storage      | Simpler tasks like synchronizing settings or sending small notifications between tabs. |
| **`postMessage`**  | Direct tab reference | Parent-child tab communication (e.g., parent tab controls child tab). |

Each of these methods has its own advantages depending on the use case. For real-time communication, **WebSocket** is the best choice, while **SharedWorker** is ideal for sharing state between tabs. **`localStorage`** is simple but effective for non-real-time communication, and **`postMessage`** works when you have direct control over the tabs.

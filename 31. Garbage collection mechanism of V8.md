# Garbage collection mechanism of V8

V8's garbage collection (GC) mechanism is efficient and complex, using a **generational garbage collection** approach. This method divides the heap into two main regions: the **new generation** and the **old generation**. Each region uses distinct algorithms optimized for the characteristics of the objects they manage.

### 1. **New Generation (Young Generation) Algorithm**

Objects in the **new generation** typically have a short lifespan, such as temporary variables or objects created during function calls. The **Scavenge** algorithm is used for this region.

#### Key Concepts:
- The new generation is divided into two spaces: **From space** and **To space**.
- Objects are initially allocated in the **From space**.
- When the **From space** becomes full, the **Scavenge algorithm** is triggered.

#### Scavenge Algorithm Workflow:
- The algorithm checks the **From space** for live (reachable) objects.
- Live objects are copied from the **From space** to the **To space**.
- Dead (unreachable) objects are discarded.
- Once the copying is complete, the roles of the **From space** and **To space** are swapped, and the process repeats when necessary.

This copying approach prevents memory fragmentation in the new generation and makes it efficient for garbage collection of short-lived objects.

#### Transition to the Old Generation:
Objects that survive one or more Scavenge cycles are promoted to the **old generation**. This transition usually occurs under two conditions:
1. The object has survived at least one Scavenge cycle.
2. The **To space** occupancy exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 25%), prompting the promotion of surviving objects to avoid memory pressure in the new generation.

### 2. **Old Generation Algorithm**

Objects in the **old generation** typically have longer lifespans and are more numerous. V8 uses two primary algorithms to manage this space: **Mark-Sweep** and **Mark-Compact**.

#### Mark-Sweep Algorithm:
This algorithm is used when space in the old generation becomes fragmented or when there is insufficient memory to accommodate new objects.

1. **Mark Phase**:  
   - The garbage collector traverses the heap, marking all live (reachable) objects. This phase can be time-consuming, especially when there are many objects to check.
   
2. **Sweep Phase**:  
   - Once the marking is complete, the collector sweeps through the heap, deallocating memory for objects that were not marked (i.e., dead objects).

However, this process can lead to **memory fragmentation**, where small gaps of free memory are scattered across the heap.

#### Mark-Compact Algorithm:
To address fragmentation, V8 employs the **Mark-Compact** algorithm, which is triggered when memory fragmentation exceeds a certain threshold.

1. **Mark Phase**:  
   Similar to the Mark-Sweep algorithm, live objects are marked.

2. **Compact Phase**:  
   Live objects are moved to one end of the heap, compacting them together and leaving a large contiguous block of free memory at the other end. This reduces fragmentation and improves memory allocation efficiency for future objects.

### 3. **Incremental and Concurrent Marking**

In earlier versions, V8 used a **stop-the-world** approach, where the JavaScript execution was paused while the garbage collector traversed and marked objects. This could lead to noticeable performance issues, especially when dealing with large heaps.

To mitigate this, V8 introduced **incremental marking** in 2011. This technique breaks the marking process into smaller chunks, allowing the JavaScript application to run between these chunks. This reduces noticeable pauses in execution.

In 2018, V8 made another significant improvement with **concurrent marking**. This allows the garbage collector to mark objects in the background while JavaScript code continues to run. This further minimizes pauses and improves application responsiveness.

### Summary of V8's Garbage Collection Mechanism:

1. **Generational Garbage Collection**: The heap is divided into the new generation (for short-lived objects) and the old generation (for long-lived objects).
2. **Scavenge Algorithm**: Used in the new generation, with objects being copied between **From** and **To** spaces.
3. **Mark-Sweep-Compact Algorithms**: Used in the old generation to manage long-lived objects, with **Mark-Sweep** clearing dead objects and **Mark-Compact** reducing fragmentation.
4. **Incremental & Concurrent Marking**: Introduced to reduce pauses and improve application responsiveness by performing GC tasks in smaller increments or in parallel with JavaScript execution.

V8's garbage collection mechanism is highly optimized for performance, especially in modern JavaScript applications where responsiveness is critical.

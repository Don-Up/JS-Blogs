### Differences among Ajax, Axios, and Fetch

#### 1. Ajax

**Definition:**
Ajax stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML." It's a technique for creating interactive web applications. Ajax allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that parts of a web page can be updated without having to reload the whole page.

**Disadvantages:**
- **MVC Suitability:** It's more suited for MVC programming, not quite in line with the front-end MVVM trend.
- **Architecture:** Built on the not-so-clear architecture of native XHR.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Doesn't quite stick to the Separation of Concerns principle.
- **Complex Configuration:** Setup and calling methods can be a bit messy, and its event-based async model isn't friendly.

```javascript
// Example of Ajax using XHR
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'https://api.example.com/data', true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    console.log(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
  }
};
xhr.send();
```

#### 2. Fetch

**Definition:**
Fetch is often seen as AJAX's replacement, coming into play with ES6 and using its promise objects. It's all about promises, making its code structure way simpler than Ajax. Fetch isn't just a rewrap of Ajax; it's native JavaScript and does not use XMLHttpRequest objects.

**Advantages:**
- **Syntax:** Straightforward syntax, more semantic.
- **Promise-based:** Built on the standard Promise, supports async/await.
- **Rich APIs:** More fundamental, comes with a rich set of APIs (request, response).
- **Modern:** Moves away from XHR, offering a new approach in ES standards.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Error Handling:** It only throws errors for network issues, treating 400s and 500s as successes.
- **Cookies:** By default, fetch won't carry cookies. You need to tweak it with `{credentials: 'include'}`.
- **Abort Support:** Lacks support for aborting requests or controlling timeouts.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Can't natively track the progress of requests.

```javascript
// Example of Fetch
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('There has been a problem with your fetch operation:', error));
```

#### 3. Axios

**Definition:**
Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client. It supports the Promise API, making it simpler and more readable for handling HTTP requests.

**Features:**
- **Browser Support:** Launches XMLHttpRequests from browsers.
- **Node Support:** Handles HTTP requests in Node.js.
- **Promise-based:** Supports the Promise API.
- **Request/Response Interceptors:** Tracks requests and responses.
- **Transformation:** Transforms requests and responses.
- **Cancellation:** Can cancel requests.
- **JSON Handling:** Automatically handles JSON data.
- **XSRF Protection:** The client side supports to guard against XSRF attacks.

**Example:**
```javascript
// Example of Axios
axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('There was an error!', error);
  });
```

#### Summary
- **Ajax**: An older technique using `XMLHttpRequest`, with a more complex configuration and event-based async model.
- **Fetch**: A modern, Promise-based alternative that simplifies the syntax and aligns with ES6 standards but lacks comprehensive error handling and progress monitoring.
- **Axios**: A robust, Promise-based HTTP client with features like request/response interception, automatic JSON handling, and support for both browser and Node environments.

Choosing between these depends on the project requirements and personal preference for handling asynchronous requests.

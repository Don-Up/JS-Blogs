### Differences and Usage Scenarios of `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`

#### 1. `Promise.all`
`Promise.all` is used when you need to wait for multiple promises to resolve before proceeding. It takes an array of Promises and returns a new Promise that resolves when all of the Promises in the array have resolved, or rejects if any one of the Promises rejects.

**Advantages:**
- Ensures that all asynchronous operations are completed before proceeding.
- Returns an array of results corresponding to the input array of Promises, maintaining the order regardless of which Promise resolves first.

**Use Cases:**
- Loading multiple resources from network requests simultaneously.
- Running multiple asynchronous operations where each operation must be completed before proceeding.

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
Promise.all([
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data1'),
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data2')
]).then(([response1, response2]) => {
  return Promise.all([response1.json(), response2.json()]);
}).then(([data1, data2]) => {
  console.log(data1, data2); // Both datasets are available here
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Failed to fetch:', error);
});
```

#### 2. `Promise.race`
`Promise.race` is used when you need only the first resolved or rejected Promise from a set of Promises. It also takes an array of Promises but returns a new Promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the Promises in the array resolves or rejects.

**Advantages:**
- Useful for timeout patterns where an operation should not take longer than a certain amount of time.
- Good for situations where you want the quickest response among multiple asynchronous operations.

**Use Cases:**
- Implementing timeouts for fetch operations.
- Prioritizing several sources of similar data and accepting the quickest.

**Example Usage:**
```javascript
const timeout = new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timed out')), 5000));

Promise.race([
  fetch('https://api.example.com/data'),
  timeout
]).then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log(data);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

### How Promises Solve Common Problems

**Callback Hell Example:**
```javascript
fs.readFile('./a.txt', 'utf8', function(err, data) {
  fs.readFile(data, 'utf8', function(err, data) {
    fs.readFile(data, 'utf8', function(err, data) {
      console.log(data);
    });
  });
});
```
This leads to deeply nested callbacks, making the code hard to read and maintain.

**After Introducing Promises:**
```javascript
function read(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(url, 'utf8', function(error, data) {
      if (error) reject(error);
      resolve(data);
    });
  });
}

read('./a.txt')
  .then(data => read(data))
  .then(data => read(data))
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Failed:', error));
```
This approach with Promises flattens the structure, making the code more readable and easier to manage, and resolving the issue known as "callback hell."

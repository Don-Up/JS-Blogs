# Difference between Process and Thread

## I. Independence

- Processes can be considered independent applications, while threads cannot.

## II. Resources

- A process is the smallest unit for CPU resource allocation and can run independently. A thread, on the other hand, is the smallest unit of CPU scheduling and exists within a process. There can be multiple threads within a single process.

## III. Communication

- Threads can directly share resources within the same process. In contrast, processes require inter-process communication for interaction.

## IV. Scheduling

- Process switching is more expensive than thread switching. Thread is the basic unit of CPU scheduling. Thread switching does not cause process switching. However, when a thread in one process switches to a thread in another process, it will cause process switching.

## V. System Overhead

- When creating or terminating a process, the system needs to allocate or reclaim resources such as memory and I/O, which is much more costly than creating or terminating a thread. Similarly, during process switching, the CPU environment of the currently executing process and various states need to be saved and the states of the newly scheduled process need to be set. In contrast, during thread switching, only a small amount of register content needs to be saved and set, resulting in less overhead.

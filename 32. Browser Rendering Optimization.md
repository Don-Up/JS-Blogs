# Browser Rendering Optimization

## 1. For JavaScript
JavaScript blocks both HTML parsing and CSS parsing, so we can optimize by changing how JavaScript loads:

- **Try to put the JavaScript file at the end of the body.**
  
  ```html
  <body>
      <!-- Content -->
      <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
  ```

- **Try not to write `<script>` tags in the middle of the body.**

- **There are three ways to include resources with the `<script>` tag:**
  - **Direct inclusion:** Stops page rendering to load the resource file, executes the JS code immediately after loading.
  
  - **Async:** Loaded asynchronously after the download is completed, executed immediately after loading. Multiple async scripts do not guarantee loading order.
  
    ```html
    <script src="script.js" async></script>
    ```

  - **Defer:** Loaded asynchronously after the download is complete. Executes after the DOM is fully parsed if not already done. Multiple defer scripts execute in order.
  
    ```html
    <script src="script.js" defer></script>
    ```

## 2. For CSS
There are three ways to use CSS: 

- **Using `<link>`**
  - The browser sends a new HTTP thread to load the resource file while the GUI rendering thread continues.
  
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    ```

- **Using `@import`:** 
  - The GUI rendering thread temporarily stops to load the resource file and will not continue rendering until the resource is returned.
  
    ```css
    @import url('styles.css');
    ```

- **Inline styles:** Directly rendered by the GUI.

  ```html
  <style>
      /* Inline CSS */
  </style>
  ```

**Recommendation:** Use `<link>` for external styles and inline styles when necessary.

## 3. For DOM Tree and CSSOM Tree
To reduce rendering time:

- **The code level of the HTML file should not be too deep.**
- **Use semantic tags** to avoid non-standard semantic processing.
- **Reduce the hierarchy of the CSS code** since selectors are parsed from left to right.

## 4. Reduce Reflow and Redraw
- **When manipulating the DOM, try to operate at a lower level.**
- **Avoid using table layout;** small changes can cause the entire table to rearrange.
- **Use absolute or fixed positioning** to keep elements out of the document flow.
  
- **Instead of manipulating the DOM too much, create a document fragment.**
  
  ```javascript
  const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
  // Apply DOM operations to the fragment
  document.body.appendChild(fragment);
  ```

- **Set elements to `display: none` first** and show them after completing operations to avoid reflow/redraw.

- **Group multiple read or write operations together** to optimize rendering.

## Summary
The browser optimizes rendering with a **render queue** for reflow and redraw. By batching changes, multiple operations can trigger only one reflow, improving performance.

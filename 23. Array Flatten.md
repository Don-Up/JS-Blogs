# Flatten the array

### **(1) Recursive implementation**  

The common idea behind recursion is straightforward: use a recursive approach to iterate over each item. If an item is still an array, the process continues recursively to concatenate each array item.

### **(2) reduce function iteration**  

From the recursive function above, it’s clear that each array item is processed individually. The reduce method can also be used for array concatenation, simplifying the code from the first method. The transformed code is as follows:

### **(3) Spread operator implementation**  

This method uses the spread operator in conjunction with the `some` method to achieve array flattening.

### **(4) split and toString methods**  

The split and toString methods can be used together to flatten an array. Since arrays have a default toString method, you can convert an array directly into a comma-separated string, and then use split to convert the string back into an array, as shown in the following code:

Using these two methods, a multidimensional array can be directly converted into a comma-separated string and then split back into an array.

### **(5) flat in ES6**  

We can directly call the flat method in ES6 to flatten an array. Syntax for the flat method: `arr.flat([depth])`.

The `depth` parameter specifies the depth level to flatten (default is 1). If the array’s nested level is uncertain, setting depth to `Infinity` will flatten all levels.

As you can see, a nested array with two layers achieves the desired effect by setting the flat method’s parameter to `Infinity`. It can also be set to 2 for the same effect. In programming, if the number of nested layers is uncertain, using `Infinity` is the best approach to flatten the array.

### **(6) Regular Expressions and JSON methods**  

In method 4, the toString method was used. Another approach is to use `JSON.stringify` to convert the array to a string, then use regular expressions to filter out the square brackets, and finally convert it back to an array using `JSON.parse`:

```javascript
let arr = [1, [2, [3, [4, 5]]], 6];
function flatten(arr) {
  let str = JSON.stringify(arr);
  str = str.replace(/(\[|\])/g, '');
  str = '[' + str + ']';
  return JSON.parse(str); 
}
console.log(flatten(arr)); //  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

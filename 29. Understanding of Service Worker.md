# Understanding of Service Worker

A Service Worker is a separate thread that runs behind the browser and can generally be used to implement caching functions. To use a Service Worker, the transport protocol must be HTTPS. This is because the Service Worker involves request interception, which requires HTTPS protocol to ensure security.

The Service Worker implements the cache function in three steps:
1. Register the Service Worker.
   - In `index.js`:
   ```javascript
   if (navigator.serviceWorker) {
       navigator.serviceWorker
          .register('sw.js')
          .then(function(registration) {
               console.log('service worker registered successfully');
           })
          .catch(function(err) {
               console.log('servcie worker registration failed');
           });
   }
   ```
2. Listen for the `install` event and cache the required files in the callback.
   - In `sw.js`:
   ```javascript
   self.addEventListener('install', e => {
       e.waitUntil(
           caches.open('my-cache').then(function(cache) {
               return cache.addAll(['./index.html', './index.js']);
           })
       );
   });
   ```
3. Intercept all request events. If the requested data already exists in the cache, use the cache; otherwise, request the data.
   - In `sw.js`:
   ```javascript
   self.addEventListener('fetch', e => {
       e.respondWith(
           caches.match(e.request).then(function(response) {
               if (response) {
                   return response;
               }
               console.log('fetch source');
           })
       );
   });
   ```

Open the page and you can see that the Service Worker has started in the 'Application' tab of the developer tools. In the 'Cache' section, it can also be found that the required files have been cached.
